            <p><strong>Student Assistant</strong>, North-West University, March 2022 - October 2022</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I got the opportunity to help students who were having
                    trouble with the Descriptive Statistics and Inference
                    module. In this position, I helped individuals one-on-one
                    by breaking down difficult ideas and assisting them in
                    solving difficult challenges. In addition, I worked with the
                    lecturer to ensure that student papers were awarded
                    marks fairly and accurately. My knowledge of the subject
                    has improved as a result of this experience, which has also
                    improved my mentoring and communication abilities.
