            <p><strong>Promotor</strong>,Samplex Africa, November 2021 - February 2022</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In my role, I was responsible for visiting various stores
                    assigned to me and promoting Xiaomi smartphones to
                    customers. Given that Xiaomi was not a well-known brand
                    in South Africa at the time, many customers were
                    unfamiliar with it. My task was to introduce them to Xiaomi,
                    highlighting the brand's unique features and benefits to
                    encourage them to consider purchasing these
                    smartphones.

            <p><strong>Student Assistant</strong>, North-West University, March 2022 - October 2022</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I got the opportunity to help students who were having
                    trouble with the Descriptive Statistics and Inference
                    module. In this position, I helped individuals one-on-one
                    by breaking down difficult ideas and assisting them in
                    solving difficult challenges. In addition, I worked with the
                    lecturer to ensure that student papers were awarded
                    marks fairly and accurately. My knowledge of the subject
                    has improved as a result of this experience, which has also
                    improved my mentoring and communication abilities.
